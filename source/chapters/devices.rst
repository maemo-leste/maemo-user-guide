Device specific info [wip]
==========================

Droid 4
-------

Droid 4 hardware buttons
""""""""""""""""""""""""

It has three buttons on the side of the case:

**Power/lock button** - Press it to get the :ref:`chapters/ui:Power options menu`

**Two volume buttons** - Press it to adjust the :ref:`chapters/ui:Volume slider` (in landscape mode, they are reversed: left is *volume down*, right is *volume up*)

It has the old Android touch buttons: menu, home, back, search.

Some of these functions can be used:

     |menu-touch-button|
     The menu button opens the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu`

     |home-touch-button|
     The menu button opens the :ref:`chapters/ui:Task switcher`

     |back-touch-button|
     The back button does :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app navigation`, going back to the previous window/menu

     |search-touch-button|
     The search button opens the :ref:`chapters/ui:Virtual keyboard`, even if a :ref:`chapters/ui:Hardware keyboard` is available.

Droid 4 hardware keyboard
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

To use the *CTRL* key's function, you need to press *SHIFT*, and keep it pressed while you press the additional key of the needed keyboard shortcut (the usual behavior of a modifier key, as CTRL is).

To write one capital (uppercase) letter, or to use the "SHIFT" key's function (shift to the secondary symbols of the keyboard layout) you need to press *Caps Lock*, anf then press the letter.

To write capital letters continuously, keep *Caps Lock* pressed while you enter the letters.

Another way to write uppercase letter continuously is to press *Caps Lock* quickly, two times. Press it again, once, when finished, to switch back to lowercase.

Droid 4 virtual keyboard
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The virtual keyboard appears automatically when you enter a text area while the keyboard is folded/closed.

When the hardware keyboard is slided out/open, than this is used by default, so the virtual keyboard is disabled, but you can still manually call for the virtual keyboard, by pressing the search touch button. See :ref:`chapters/devices:Droid 4 virtual keyboard`.

This can be useful when you want to use symbols not available in the layout used by the hardware keyboard.
