E-mail
======

.. note:: Using this app, you can communicate using e-mail, by setting up and managing accounts, sending, and receiving emails.

When you open the E-mail application, you are greeted by the following screen:

     |email-main|

Here is the :ref:`chapters/email:New message` button, and the list of already set up e-mail accounts. The one in **bold** is the default one.

.. note:: If you didn't already set up any e-mail account, instead of showing you the account list, you will be offered to set up an account, by forwarding you to the :ref:`chapters/email:New account` wizard.

From the main screen, you can tap on any accounts you have, to go to the :ref:`chapters/email:E-mail account screen`, from where you can do several operations, like reading, writing, answering or forwarding emails, using that account.

Other general options you can find in the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu`:

    |email-main-menu|

#. :ref:`chapters/email:New account`
#. :ref:`chapters/email:Edit accounts`
#. :ref:`chapters/email:Settings`
#. :ref:`chapters/email:Send & receive`
#. :ref:`chapters/email:SMTP servers`
