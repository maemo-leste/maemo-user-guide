.. index:: Contacts

Contacts
========

.. note:: Using this application, you can manage your contacts: add, change, remove, import and export them.

When you open the application, the list of your contacts will be shown.

     |contacts-main|

The number next to **All contacts**, in brackets,  represents the total number of contacts.

If you don't have any contacts yet, you will be automatically shown the :ref:`chapters/contacts:Get contacts` menu, from where you can get already existing contacts, by synchronizing, or importing.

.. note:: New addresses you receive instant messages (:term:`IM`) from will be automatically added as contacts. Only the IM address/ID will be filled-in, but you can add other information by editing the created contact.

Tapping on a contact will show the details about that contact.

     |contact|

From there you can also edit it, or share data about it.

Below the photo there's the status (online/busy/offline) of the contact's :term:`IM` account:

     |contact-online| |contact-offline|

.. index:: Edit contacts

Tap on the photo of the contact to quickly :ref:`chapters/contacts:Edit` it.

Tapping on any contact data field will trigger a corresponding action, depending on the data type:

Tapping on a phone number preceded by a :term:`Handset symbol` will open the :ref:`chapters/dialer:Dialer` application.

     |contact-phone-handset|

Tapping on a phone number preceded by an envelope will open the :ref:`chapters/conversations:Conversations` application.

     |contact-phone-envelope|

Tapping on an e-mail address will open the :ref:`chapters/email:E-mail` application.

     |contact-email-address|

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior`: Tapping on an Jabber/XMPP address will not open the :ref:`chapters/conversations:Conversations` application, but instead will just go back to the :ref:`chapters/contacts:Contacts` application main screen (contact list).

     |contact-im-id|

**Options per-contact**

Tap on the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu` of the contact, for more options.

     |contact-edit|

You have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Edit`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send contact card`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send contact detail`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Merge contact`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Delete contact`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Create shortcut`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Authorization request`

Edit
----

Editing a contact has the same options as creating a :ref:`chapters/contacts:New contact`.

.. index:: Share contact
.. index:: Send contact

Send contact card
-----------------

This option will allow you sending contact data of a person to someone, in the form of a contact card.

When you pick this option, you are asked about the way of sending the contact card:

     |contact-card-send-via|

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send via Text message`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send via Bluetooth`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send via E-mail`

Send via Text message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior` This should send the contact data through a text message, but it doesn't seem to work. It does nothing.

Send via Bluetooth
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior` This should send the contact data through Bluetooth, but it doesn't seem to work. It gives an internal error.

Send via E-mail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will open the :ref:`chapters/email:E-mail` application, to send the contact data through e-mail.

And then you have the choice of also sending the avatar of the contact with the contact card, or not:

     |contact-send-avatar|

Send contact detail
-------------------

This option will allow you sending just one contact detail (phone number, e-mail address, etc.) to someone.

Pick the detail (name, phone number, e-mail address, :term:`XMPP`/:term:`Jabber` ID, etc.) that you want to send:

     |contact-detail-send|

You are then asked about the way of sending the contact detail:

     |contact-detail-send-via|

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send via Text message`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send via Bluetooth`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send via E-mail`

.. index:: Merge contacts

Merge contact
-------------

This allows you to merge more contacts into a single one.

In case of differences or conflicts between unique field types, such as name or surname, you will be asked to choose which data will be saved in the final merged contact file. Here, in case of a last name conflict:

     |contact-merge-conflict|

Tap on the **Last name** field and select the chosen version:

     |contact-merge-conflict-name|

Different IDs or phone numbers will simply be added as supplementary contact data fields to the resulting merged contact file. In this case, a second phone number for calling or sending :term:`SMS` is added:

     |contact-merged|

Delete contact
--------------

This will delete the current contact, including the :term:`XMPP`/:term:`Jabber` IDs associated to it.

     |contact-delete-confirm|

Confirm deleting the contact by tapping on **Yes**.

.. index:: Contact shortcut on main screen

Create shortcut
---------------

This will create a shortcut of the contact on the main screen / desktop.

     |contact-main-screen-shortcut|

It shows the account's picture, and below, the status (online/busy/offline) of the contact's :term:`IM` account, and the contact's first name.

Authorization request
---------------------

This will request from the contact the authorization to receive presence and status updates.
It will have to be confirmed in the remote client application by the contact.

**Options in the in-app menu**

Other general options are available in the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu` of the Contacts application.

     |contacts-in-app-menu|

Available options:

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Sort by ABC/Availability/Recent`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:New contact`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Get contacts`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:My information`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Settings`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Delete contacts`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Export`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Groups`

The following options won't be available if you have no contacts: **Delete contacts**, **Export**, **Groups**.

.. index:: Sort contacts

Sort by ABC/Availability/Recent
-------------------------------

Choosing between the three options available here will change the order of the displayed contacts in the list accordingly.

#. **ABC** - Alphabetically
#. **Availability**
#. **Recent**

New contact
-----------

Here you can create a new contact entry.

     |contact-new|

You have the following options available for each contact:

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Avatar image`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Cell button`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:E-mail button`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Add field`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Delete fields`

You have two fixed fields, **First name** and **Last name**.
The default optional fields are **Cell** and **E-mail**.
You can change them by tapping the button in front of them, add other fields, by using the **Add field** button, or delete them, by using the **Delete fields** button.

Avatar image
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here you can select an image as the contact's avatar.

     |contact-select-image|

Tapping on browse allows you to select a picture from the device's storage, to use as avatar.

     |contact-select-image-file|

Cell button
^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, instead of the default optional field **Cell**, you can select another type of phone number as that field's name/description:

     |contact-phone-1|

The list is long, so it goes on yet another screen:

     |contact-phone-2|

E-mail button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here, instead of the default optional field **E-mail**, you can select another type of e-mail address as that field's name/description:

     |contact-email|

Add field
^^^^^^^^^

Here you can add other different fields to the contact such as messaging, birthday or job information:

#. AIM
#. Gadu-Gadu
#. GroupWise
#. ICQ
#. Jabber

     |contact-new-field-1|

#. SIMPLE
#. Sametime
#. Zephyr
#. Birthday
#. Address

     |contact-new-field-2|

#. Address (home)
#. Address (work)
#. Web page
#. Gender

     |contact-new-field-3|

#. Nickname
#. Job title
#. Company
#. Note

     |contact-new-field-4|

After adding more fields, the contact entry will look something like this:

     |contact-added-fields|

Delete fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using this option you can delete one or more of the optional fields (other than the **First name** or the **Last name**).

Select the fields you want to delete:

     |contact-delete-fields|

You will be asked to confirm. Tap on **Yes** if you really want to delete those fields, or tap on **No** if it was a mistake, or if you changed your mind (It happens, we know, don't worry).

     |contact-delete-fields-confirm|

A completed new contact typically looks like this:

     |contact-new-done|

You can now tap on **Save**.

.. index:: Import contacts

Get contacts
------------

Besides creating new contact entries, you have also the possibility of getting (importing) existing contact records.

     |contacts-get|

You have the following ways of getting contact records:

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Synchronize from other device`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Import contacts from new account`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Import contacts`

Synchronize from other device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Leftovers` This option is not working, so probably it's some leftover from older versions of the OS.

Import contacts from new account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This points you to :ref:`chapters/settings:VoIP and IM accounts`, where you can add a new account, by tapping on **New**.

The already known contacts of the newly configured :term:`IM` account(s) will be added to contacts.

Import contacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using this option you can import contacts from files in the :term:`filesystem`.

     |contacts-import|

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Import contacts file`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Import contacts folder`

Import contacts file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This way you can import the contacts contained in one file:

     |contacts-import-files|

Navigate through the :term:`filesystem` until you reach the desired file.

Import contacts folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This way you can import contacts from all files in a folder:

     |contacts-import-folder|

Navigate through the :term:`filesystem` until you reach the desired folder.

My information
--------------

If you didn't already add information about yourself, you will be shown a form for you to complete this data.

     |contact-my-information-add|

If you go back, pressing outside the menu, you will be shown the default information about yourself.

Otherwise, if you already added information about yourself, you will be shown that data on the following page.

     |contact-my-information|

Afterwards you will be shown straight this page. To further edit your data, you will have to pick Edit from the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu`.

There, in the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu` there are also other options.

     |contact-my-edit|

The options are the following:

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Edit`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Accounts`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:E-mail`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send contact card`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Send contact detail`

Accounts
^^^^^^^^

This takes you to the :ref:`chapters/settings:VoIP and IM accounts` menu in :ref:`chapters/settings:Settings`

E-mail
^^^^^^
This takes you to the :ref:`chapters/email:E-mail` application.

Settings
--------

This allows you to configure the Contacts application.

     |contacts-settings|

You have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Display names`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Display video calling option`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Display SMS only for Cell numbers`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Delete all contacts from device`
#. :ref:`chapters/contacts:Voicemail number`

Display names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configures how the names will be displayed in the contacts list:

     |contacts-settings-display-name|

    * **First name Last name** - Example: **My Friend**
    * **Last name, First name** - Example: **Friend, My**
    * **Last name First name** - Example: **Friend My**
    * **Nickname** - Example: **myfri3nd**

Display video calling option
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Untested - This should enable showing a video calling option for the numbers or accounts which support this.

Display SMS only for Cell numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior` This should show the SMS sending option only for the phone numbers in a **Cell** type field. but instead it shows no option (no calling either). This way, some phone numbers might be hidden or appear as missing, unless entering the :ref:`chapters/contacts:Edit` mode.

.. index:: Delete all contacts

Delete all contacts from device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: This will delete all contacts from the device.

     |contacts-delete-all|

As mentioned, the contacts associated to the IM accounts won't be also deleted from the IM server.

Voicemail number
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here you can set the phone number which allows you to access the voicemail, in case your mobile phone service provides it.

     |contacts-voicemail-number|

The previously saved numbers are available as options to pick, besides writing a new one. The name of the provider you were connected to when saving it is mentioned next to each number.

.. index:: Delete contacts

Delete contacts
---------------

This allows you to delete contacts.

     |contacts-delete-select|

Select the contacts you want to delete. A white check mark will appear next to the each contact you select.

Then tap on **Delete**.

     |contact-delete-confirm|

You will have to confirm.

As mentioned, deleting the contact which includes an :term:`Jabber`/:term:`XMPP` ID will also remove it from the :term:`Jabber`/:term:`XMPP` contacts.

Export
------

.. warning:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior` When selecting this, the contacts application gives an internal error and crashes.

Groups
------

This shows groups which were established based on :term:`XMPP`/:term:`Jabber` accounts.

     |contacts-groups|

Selecting a group will show the contacts related to this :term:`XMPP`/:term:`Jabber` account.

While viewing this list, you have the following options in the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu`:

     |contacts-groups-menu|

    * **Accounts** - This takes you to :ref:`chapters/settings:VoIP and IM accounts` in :ref:`chapters/settings:Settings`
