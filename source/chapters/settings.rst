========

.. note:: Using this app, you can change the device settings.

     |application-menu-button|

     |settings-icon|

You will be greeted with the following settings list:

The list goes on two screens:

    |settings-main-2|

The available options are grouped in three sections, plus in the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu`:

    |settings-in-app-menu|

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Personalization`
    #. :ref:`chapters/settings:Themes`
    #. :ref:`chapters/settings:Language & region`
    #. :ref:`chapters/settings:Notification light`
    #. :ref:`chapters/settings:Profiles`
    #. :ref:`chapters/settings:Date and time`

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Date format`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Decimal separator (read-only)`

Device language
"""""""""""""""

You will be shown a list, through which you can scroll and select your desired interface language:

|device-language|

.. note:: You can also type to search, but you will need to have a method of :ref:`chapters/ui:Input and keyboard` layout which includes the potentially special characters of the language you search for, since native language names are being used.

Date format (read-only)
"""""""""""""""""""""""

This shows how the date is being displayed based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:Device language`.

Date format
"""""""""""

|date-format|

Decimal separator (read-only)

You will have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Hardware keyboard layout`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Use virtual keyboard`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Word completion`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Auto-capitalization`
