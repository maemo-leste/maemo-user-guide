Themes
------

You have a list of available themes that you can pick from, to have an uniform design look of the interface.

     |select-theme|

.. note:: You can install more themes from the :ref:`summary:Application Manager`.

Language & region
-----------------

You will be greeted with the following screen:

     |language-n-region|

The following options will be available:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Date format (read-only)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Date format`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Decimal separator (read-only)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Thousands separator (read-only)`

.. warning:: Saving these settings will require the device to reboot

Device language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will be shown a list, through which you can scroll and select your desired interface language:

     |device-language|

.. note:: You can also type to search, but you will need to have a method of :ref:`chapters/ui:Input and keyboard` layout which includes the potentially special characters of the language you search for, since native language names are being used.

Date format (read-only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows how the date is being displayed based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:Device language`.

Date format
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: This is probably a bug, while it should be named Regional format, instead of date format. See :ref:`summary:Known bugs`.


You will be shown a list, through which you can scroll and select the country corresponding to the your desired regional format:

     |date-format|

Decimal separator (read-only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows which decimal separator is being used, based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:date format`.

Thousands separator (read-only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows which thousands separator is being used, based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:date format`.

Notification light
------------------

You will be shown a menu from where you select the desired settings regarding notifications using the LED light.

     |notification-light-1|

The options go on two screens:

     |notification-light-1|

The following options are available:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Device on`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Missed call`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Text message received`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:E-mail message received`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Instant message received`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Charging`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Other notifications`

Check the situations when you would like to have notifications signaled by the LED (if your device has one - see see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`)

Device on
^^^^^^^^^

Use the notification light to show that the device is on, when the display is off.

Missed call
^^^^^^^^^^^

Notify missed calls.

Text message received
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notify when there's an incoming text message (SMS).

E-mail message received
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notify when there's a new e-mail message received.

Instant message received
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notify when there's an incoming instant message (IM).

Charging
^^^^^^^^

Notify when the device's battery is charging.

Profiles
--------

Selecting *Profiles* gives you the list of the existing sound profiles.

Besides the default General and Silent, you can make your own custom profiles.

    |profiles-custom|

Here you have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Delete (profile)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Edit (profile)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:New (profile)`

When finished modifying settings, tap on *Done*.

Delete (profile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tap on *Delete* to remove the selected custom profile.

The default profiles cannot be deleted, so the *Delete* button won't be present if you have no custom profiles configured.

    |profiles-main|

Edit (profile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tap on *Edit* to modify the sselected profile.

Editing profiles gives the same options as when creating a :ref:`chapters/settings:New (profile)`.

New (profile)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by giving the new profile a name. See :ref:`chapters/ui:Input and keyboard` about how to input text.

    |profiles-new-name|

Then, when you tap on *Done*, a menu with options will appear.

    |profiles-new-settings-1|

The menu goes on more pages.

    |profiles-new-settings-2|

Some options' availability depends on enabling others.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    |hardware-keyboard-layout|

.. note:: The layout for the hardware keyboard doesn't seem to change. Possible bug. See :ref:`summary:Known bugs`

Use virtual keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This enables the use of virtual (on-screen) keyboard.

If this is disabled, the virtual keyboard won't work, but you can still use the hardware keyboard, if your device has one (see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`).

Word completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This enables automatic word completion.

.. note:: Word completion doesn't seem to work. Possible bug. See :ref:`summary:Known bugs`

Auto-capitalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This enables automatic capitalization of words at the beginning of sentences (the first letter after *full stop* + *space*, or *full stop* + *new line* will be uppercase - the first letter after only *new line* won't be uppercased).
The effects of this setting can be changed by using the *SHIFT* key (for the exact key name on your device, see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`).
