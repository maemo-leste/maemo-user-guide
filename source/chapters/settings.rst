.. warning:: Saving these settings will require the device to reboot

Device language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will be shown a list, through which you can scroll and select your desired interface language:

|device-language|

.. note:: You can also type to search, but you will need to have a method of :ref:`chapters/ui:Input and keyboard` layout which includes the potentially special characters of the language you search for, since native language names are being used.

Date format (read-only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows how the date is being displayed based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:Device language`.

Date format
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: This is probably a bug, while it should be named Regional format, instead of date format. See :ref:`summary:Known bugs`.


You will be shown a list, through which you can scroll and select the country corresponding to the your desired regional format:

|date-format|

Decimal separator (read-only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows which decimal separator is being used, based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:date format`.

Thousands separator (read-only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This shows which thousands separator is being used, based on the currently set :ref:`chapters/settings:date format`.

Notification light
------------------

     |date-time-main|

The following options will be available:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:24-hr clock`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Time zone`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Date`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Time`

24-hr clock
^^^^^^^^^^^
When ticked, the clock will be displayed as 24-hour (also called military time).
    |date-time-24h|

Untick it, and hit the Save button, and then the clock will be displayed as 12-hour clock (AM and PM).
    |date-time-12h|

.. index:: Time zone

Time zone
^^^^^^^^^
You will be shown a map, where the current place is shown (and its time zone and name written on the bottom of the screen), and from where you can change it, by selecting the place which is closest to your location (or one which is in your local timezone). You can select the place by choosing it from the map.
    |choose-time-zone-London|

When ready, tap on *Done*, at the top of the screen, if you want to save the changes.

.. note:: You can also search for a place by tapping on the magnifier on top of the screen.
    |choose-time-zone-search|

And then you can type to search for a place to select as your local time place.
    |choose-time-zone-select-Chisinau|

Your new time zone location will then be displayed.
    |choose-time-zone-Chisinau|

When ready, tap on *Done*. Otherwise, search for a different place.

Display
-------

Text input
----------

When you select Text input from :ref:`chapters/settings:Settings`, the following menu is shown:

    |text-input-1|

The menu is long, so it goes on two pages:

    |text-input-2|

You will have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Hardware keyboard layout`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Use virtual keyboard`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Word completion`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Auto-capitalization`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Insert space after word`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:1st language`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:2nd language`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Dictionary (of the 1st language)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Dictionary (of the 2nd language)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Use dual dictionaries`

Hardware keyboard layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    |hardware-keyboard-layout|

.. note:: The layout for the hardware keyboard doesn't seem to change. Possible bug. See :ref:`summary:Known bugs`

Use virtual keyboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This enables the use of virtual (on-screen) keyboard.

If this is disabled, the virtual keyboard won't work, but you can still use the hardware keyboard, if your device has one (see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`).

Word completion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This enables automatic word completion.

.. note:: Word completion doesn't seem to work. Possible bug. See :ref:`summary:Known bugs`

Auto-capitalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This enables automatic capitalization of words at the beginning of sentences (the first letter after *full stop* + *space*, or *full stop* + *new line* will be uppercase - the first letter after only *new line* won't be uppercased).
The effects of this setting can be changed by using the *SHIFT* key (for the exact key name on your device, see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`).

Insert space after word
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option enables adding a space after each word chosen through the :ref:`chapters/settings:Auto-capitalization` option.

1st language
^^^^^^^^^^^^

From here you can select the layout number one, of the virtual keyboard.

    |keyboard-first-language|

You can have two layouts set, between which you can switch. Select the second layout from the option :ref:`chapters/settings:2nd language`.

Dictionary (of the 1st language)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    |keyboard-first-language-dictionary|

2nd language
^^^^^^^^^^^^

From here you can select the layout number two, of the virtual keyboard.

    |keyboard-second-language|

You can have two layouts set, between which you can switch. Select the first layout from the option :ref:`chapters/settings:1st language`.

Dictionary (of the 2nd language)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    |keyboard-second-language-dictionary|

Use dual dictionaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This option is active only if you have two languages set. Then, the :ref:`chapters/settings:Text input` menu's second page looks like this:

    |text-input-two-languages|

Then, when this is enabled, words are being searched for in both languages, when using :ref:`chapters/settings:Word completion`.

Location
--------

Here you can adjust the location-related settings, such as those for the GPS, or for the network-based location detection:

    |location-1|

There's also a second page:

    |location-2|

The options here are in two categories:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:GPS`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Network positioning`

GPS
^^^

For the :term:`GPS`, the options are the following:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Enable (GPS)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:GPS device`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Pair new device`

Enable (GPS)
""""""""""""

Checking this enables the :term:`GPS` device, using it for satellite-based location detection.

GPS device
""""""""""

Here you can select between the available :term:`GPS` devices, such as the internal one, or any externally connected ones.

    |gps-device|

Pair new device
"""""""""""""""

Here you can connect to (pair) an external :term:`GPS` device, to use it for location detection.

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior`: Pressing on :ref:`chapters/settings:Pair new device` to pair a new external :term:`GPS` device seems to not do anything.

Network positioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here are the settings for the network-based location detection:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Enable (Network positioning)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Location server`

.. note:: Possible :ref:`summary:Leftovers`: The network positioning service seems to not work. supl.nokia.com is given as default server, which seems to not be reachable anymore.

Enable (Network positioning)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Checking this enables network positioning, using it for mobile network-based location detection.

Location server
"""""""""""""""

Choose the server which is being used to provide network positioning.

Internet connections
--------------------

From here you can configure the ways to connect to internet, through WiFi, or through mobile networks.

    |internet-connections-main|

You have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Connect automatically`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Search interval`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Switch to Wi-Fi when available`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Connections`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Save (Internet connections)`

.. tip:: If you just want to connect to a visible WiFi network, or to an already-known-to-work mobile connection, it's easier to do it from the :ref:`chapters/ui:Internet connection menu`.

Connect automatically
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This options specifies whether any type of connection should be automatically activated, and which.

    |internet-connect-automatically|

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Always ask`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Wi-Fi`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Mobile connection (Orange)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Any connection`

Always ask
""""""""""

Never automatically connect, ask each time instead.

Wi-Fi
"""""

Automatically connect to available saved WiFi networks.

Mobile connection (Orange)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Automatically connect to mobile data.

.. note:: In this case the available network was Orange, so the name of the network appears here as an option for auto-connect.

Any connection
""""""""""""""

Connect automatically to any available connection, be it WiFi or mobile.

.. note:: To set the priority, WiFi over mobile, or the other way around, see :ref:`chapters/settings:Switch to Wi-Fi when available`.

Search interval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    |internet-connections-search-interval|


Switch to Wi-Fi when available
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check to give priority to Wi-Fi over mobile data, when a saved WiFi connection is available.

Especially useful when connecting to :ref:`chapters/settings:Any connection` is active.

Connections
^^^^^^^^^^^

Here you can see the list of saved WiFi networks, and the available mobile network:

    |internet-connections-list|

And you have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/settings:New (WiFi connection)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Edit (WiFi connection)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Edit (Mobile connection)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Delete (Connections)`
#. :ref:`chapters/settings:Done (Connections)`

New (WiFi connection)
"""""""""""""""""""""

You will be carried through a multi-page configuration wizard.

On each of the steps, after you finished configuring the options on that page, you go forward by pressing *Next*, or backwards, to the previous page, by pressing *Previous*.

    |internet-connections-wifi-setup|

Tap *Next* to continue.

    |internet-connections-wifi-name|

Write a network name. See :ref:`chapters/ui:Input and keyboard` about how to do input text.

The network name is a local name, like a bookmark, so it can be different than the network's actual name (SSID).

Tap *Next* to continue.

    |internet-connections-wifi-scan|

You will be asked whether to scan for available WiFi networks.

If you want to add a hidden network, or one that is not in range, select *No* here.

You will then be able to manually add the network settings:

    |internet-connections-wifi-manual-1|

#. Network name (SSID)
#. Network is hidden (keep checked if the network you want to add is hidden)
#. Network mode:

    |internet-connections-wifi-manual-2|

    * Infrastructure (AP-mode)
    * Ad hoc (No need of an AP)
#. Security method:

    |internet-connections-wifi-manual-3|

    * None
    * WEP
    * WPA pre-shared key
    * WPA with EAP

If you select *Yes* when you are asked to scan for WiFi networks, then you will receive the list of available WiFi networks:
