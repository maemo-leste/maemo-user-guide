Customize the main screen
-------------------------

Tapping on the :ref:`chapters/ui:Desktop settings button` will allow you to customize the :ref:`chapters/ui:Main screen (Desktop)`.

     |customize-main-screen|

The screen backround will fade-out, and the shortcuts on the current desktop view will be shown. If there are none, an empty screen will be displayed.

Here you can change the positioning on the screen of the existing shortcuts. To add new shortcuts, access the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu` and :ref:`chapters/ui:Add shortcut`,.

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior`: It's not possible to move a shortcut from another desktop view then the currently displayed one (you need to see it in order to select it), so make sure you move to the correct one before tapping on the settings button. Adding a new shortcut, though, is possible, from any desktop view.

From here, you can access the :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app menu` of the desktop settings, to customize the current desktop view.

The following menu will be shown:

     |desktop-settings|

You will have the following options:

#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Add shortcut`
#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Manage views`
#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Change background`
#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Themes`

.. index:: Add shortcut on the main screen

Add shortcut
""""""""""""

When you select the Add shortcut option, a list of available shortcuts will be shown.

     |add-shortcut-list|

Select the desired shortcut, from the list. It will be placed on the first available free spot in the current desktop view.

     |add-shortcut-first|

From there, tap and drag it to move it anywhere on the screen.

You can then add more, and move them to organize them.

     |add-shortcut-more|

Tapping on the small X on the top right of each shortcut, deletes it.

Moving a shortcut to the right or left edge of the screen, alllows you to move it to another screen.

.. index:: Manage screen views

Manage views
""""""""""""

Tapping on Manage views will show you the list of desktop views.

     |activate-views|

You can enable or disable views. Check a view to enable it.

The maximum number of views is four.

.. warning:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior`: Disabling a view will delete the shortcuts from that particular view, without warning. Make sure you move the shortcuts you want to keep to another view, before disabling the view. One way to tell which screen is which, is by comparing walpapers of each view. Oterwise you will have to add them again, see :ref:`chapters/ui:Add shortcut`.

.. index:: Change desktop background

Change background
"""""""""""""""""

Tapping on Change background will allow you to change the desktop background.

     |choose-background-image|

One way to change the desktop backround is to select one of the available :ref:`chapters/ui:Themes`.

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Leftovers`: Get more from Ovi Store option doesn't work, since this is part of the old Maemo system, and thus the Ovi Store is not available.

Tapping on more allows you to use custom images as background image.

     |add-image|

Navigate through the File System, to the desired image file.

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior`: Manually changing the desktop image (outside of a theme) will only change the image of the current desktop view. Each view should then have a different image, and if any fluid transition between views is desired, then that particular image should be prepared (split accordingly) in advance, in an external program.

.. index:: Themes

Themes
""""""

Tapping on themes gives you a list of the available themes that you can pick from, to have an uniformous design look of the interface.

     |select-theme|

UI Navigation
-------------

To navigate through the device's interface, you have three areas of control:

#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Top-left area`
#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Top-right area`
#. :ref:`chapters/ui:Area around menus`

Top-left area
"""""""""""""

Depending on where you are, here the following can be shown:

     |task-launcher|
     The App menu (Task launcher) button

Tapping on it will take you to the :ref:`chapters/ui:Application menu`

     |task-switcher-button|
     The dashboard (Task switcher) button

Tapping on it will take you to the :ref:`chapters/ui:Task switcher`

     |task-switcher-button-highlight|
     The blinking dashboard (task switcher) button

When the dashboard button is blinking, it means that you have unread :ref:`chapters/ui:Notifications`.

Top-right area
""""""""""""""

Depending on where you are, here the following can be shown:

     |close-button|
     The X button

Tapping on it will close the current application. See :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app navigation`.

     |back-button|
     The back arrow

Tapping on it will take you to the previous window/menu of the current application. See :ref:`chapters/ui:In-app navigation`.

Area around menus
"""""""""""""""""

When you are in a menu, you can close that menu and go back to the previous screen or application, by tapping in the empty area around it.

.. tip:: When you want to exit a menu without saving any changes, and that menu doesn't have a cancel button, tapping outside of it will do exactly this.

Task switcher
"""""""""""""

Tapping on the task switcher button in the :ref:`chapters/ui:Top-left area` will take you to the task switcher, showing stacked snapshots of all the currently running applications, from where you can switch between apps.

     |task-switcher|

Depending on how many apps you have open, they there will be shown stacked on more or fewer rows.

Tapping on a app snapshot will switch to that app, and will show it on full-screen.

Tapping on the small X button on top right of each application window, will close that particular app.

When in the task switcher, the button in the :ref:`chapters/ui:Top-left area` switches to App menu (Task launcher) button.

.. tip:: To open the task switcher, you can also use the home button (if the device has it), see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`.

Pressing it while already in the Task switcher takes you to the App menu (Task launcher).

.. tip:: From an application, tap on the task switcher button once, to switch to another application, or tap on it twice, to start a new application without closing the current one.

In-app navigation
"""""""""""""""""

The windows in an application are stacked.

When you select an option, press a button, or open a menu, the previous window will be go to the back as you navigate further through the application.

In the :ref:`chapters/ui:Top-right area`, depending on whether you are in the main application window or not, the button shown will either be:

      |close-button|
      An X

      |back-button|
      A back button

The X button, which closes the application, will switch to a back arrow, when you navigate away from the main window of the application.

Tapping on that arrow will take you back to the previous window or menu, until you will reach the main window of the application, when the back arrow will switch back to the X button.

.. tip:: To go back, you can also use the back hardware button (if the device has it), see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`

.. index:: In-app menu

Progress indicator
""""""""""""""""""

     |progress-indicator|

When this rotating graphical symbol (also called a throbber) is being shown next to a menu or window title, it means that something is being worked out, or processed, and that you should wait until the current action is finished, until taking another action.

In-app menu
"""""""""""

Touching the title of a currently application or window, will open the in-app menu, where you can access settings of that application/window.

     |menu-indicator|
     The presence of the in-app menu is (sometimes, see note below) signaled by this down-pointing arrow.

.. note:: :ref:`summary:Unexpected behavior`: Even if this arrow is not shown, tapping on the title of the application will show the in-app menu.

.. tip:: To access the in-app menu, you can also use the menu hardware button (if the device has it), see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`

Menus don't have a In-app menu of themselves, only windows have it.

.. index:: Notifications

Notifications
-------------

Notifications appear as part of the task switcher.

When there are new notifications, the dashboard button in the :ref:`chapters/ui:Top-left area` will be highlighted/blinking.

When you have more applications open, and more active notifications, the :ref:`chapters/ui:Task switcher` (dashboard) will look like this:

     |notification-mosaic|

Input and keyboard
------------------

Hardware keyboard
"""""""""""""""""

Some devices have hardware keyboards, others don't.

For details about what a particular model has, and how the keys of the hardware keyboard match the layout, see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`

Virtual keyboard
""""""""""""""""

The virtual keyboard is especially useful when the device is being used in portrait mode (for devices with a sliding keyboard), or for devices without a hardware keyboard. See :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`

The first layer of the keyboard contains the lowercase letters, and some of the most used punctuation marks:

     |virtual-keyboard-first-layer|

You get to the second layer of the keyboard by pressing the Shift key:

     |virtual-keyboard-shift-key|

The second layer contains the capital (uppercase) letters, and the other most used punctuation marks:

     |virtual-keyboard-second-layer|

You get to the third layer of the keyboard, by pressing the Numeric key:

     |virtual-keyboard-numeric-key|

The third layer of the keyboard contains the numbers, and other punctuation marks and symbols:

     |virtual-keyboard-third-layer|

By pressing both the Numeric and Shift keys, you get to the fourth layer, which contains less used punctuation marks and symbols:

     |virtual-keyboard-fourth-layer|

To quickly access some tools related to the keyboard, tap on the Keyboard menu key:

     |virtual-keyboard-menu-key|

A menu will be shown, from which you can choose the following:

#. Cut (move the selected text somewhere else)
#. Copy (Copy the selected text somewhere else)
#. Paste (insert here the text you cut, or copied from somewhere else)

     |virtual-keyboard-menu|

If you have two languages set for :ref:`chapters/settings:Text input`, they will be visible in this menu, too, and you can switch between them from here:

     |virtual-keyboard-menu-two-languages|

Keyboard layout
"""""""""""""""

You can set the layout for the hardware keyboard, and two layouts for the virtual keyboard from :ref:`chapters/settings:Text input` in Settings.

You can then switch between the two preset layouts of the virtual keyboard, from the Keyboard menu of the :ref:`chapters/ui:Virtual keyboard`.

Editing text
""""""""""""

To select text, swipe your finger from the start point to the end point of the text you want to select.

     |select-text|

To copy text, press *CTRL* (The actual key on the keyboard might differ, see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`) and *C*

To paste copied text, press *CTRL* (The actual key on the keyboard might differ, see :ref:`chapters/devices:Device specific info [wip]`) and *V*

To copy or move text using the virtual keyboard, use the options from the menu of the :ref:`chapters/ui:Virtual keyboard`.

     |virtual-keyboard-menu|

You can also move text by dragging the selected text to another position.

     |move-text-drag|
