      Global System for Mobile Communications, the standard for the second generation (:term:`2G`) digital cellular (mobile) networks

    GPRS
      General Packet Radio Service, standard used by :term:`2G` and :term:`3G` networks, to provide data communication

    EDGE
      Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution, standard used by :term:`2G` and :term:`3G` networks, to provide data communication, also known as Enhanced :term:`GPRS` (EGPRS)

    UMTS
      Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, a third generation (:term:`3G`) mobile cellular system for networks based on the :term:`GSM` standard.

    HSPA
      High Speed Packet Access, mobile data protocol family, for :term:`3.5G` networks

    LTE
      Long-term evolution, a fourth generation (:term:`4G`) mobile cellular system, based on the :term:`GSM` and :term:`UMTS` standards

    2G
      Second generation cellular network, using the :term:`GSM` standard

    2.5G
      Second and a half generation cellular network, using the :term:`GPRS` standard for data communication

    2.75G
      Second and 75% generation cellular network, using the :term:`EDGE` standard for data communication

    3G
      Third generation cellular network, using the :term:`UMTS` standard

    3.5G
      Third and a half generation cellular network, using the :term:`HSPA` standard

    4G
      Fourth generation cellular network, based on the :term:`LTE` standard

    5G
      Fifth generation cellular network, based on the :term:`5G NR` standard

    5G NR
      5G New Radio, a fifth generation mobile network standard, designed for :term:`5G` networks.

    GPS
      Global Positioning System (GPS), One of the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS).

    WPA
      Wi-Fi Protected Access. Security standard for Wi-Fi networks, more secure than the previous standard, :term:`WEP`.

    WEP
      Wired Equivalent Privacy. Security algorithm for Wi-Fi networks, intended to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network. It's considered to be weak from a security point of view, and it was superseded by :term:`WPA`.

    APN
      Access Point Name. The name of a :term:`gateway` between a mobile network (:term:`GSM`, :term:`GPRS`, :term:`3G`, :term:`4G` and :term:`5G`) and another computer network, usually for connecting to the internet.

    Gateway
      A device which provides a connection between networks
